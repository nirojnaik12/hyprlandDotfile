# HYPRLAND CONFIG FILE

I am a Arch user, I want a backup file for my ease so that whenever I crash my OS .Atleast I can get back my old config files 
Currently I am trying to config my wm i.e. hyprland so I continue my update every week if I did any changes.
The config file my look similar to some other DotFiles. I respect their effort and hardworks, and I mention them them in the file as a author so don't try to creat any mess

### How to install hyprland on your distro

you can install it by package manager or manually. For different distro there is different package manger available.
But for the debian there may not be stable option for you guys. Also there is an option for ubuntu [click here](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland),it will lead you the repo.
