# HYPRLAND CONFIG FILE

I am an Arch user, and I want to maintain a backup of my configuration files for convenience. This way, if I ever crash my OS, I can easily restore my old configs. Currently, I'm working on configuring my window manager (Hyprland), and I update my config files weekly whenever I make changes. Some of my config files might look similar to other dotfiles available online. I deeply respect the effort and hard work of the original creators, and I always give proper credit to them as authors in my files. Please don't misuse or create unnecessary confusion.

### How to install hyprland on your distro

You can install Hyprland using a package manager or manually. The installation method may vary depending on your Linux distribution, as different distros have different package managers. For Debian-based systems, a stable package might not always be available. However, there are options for Ubuntu users as well. You can find more details and installation instructions in the official repository.[click here](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland) to visit the repository .
I recomand you to read instructions from [Hyperland Wiki](https://wiki.hypr.land/Getting-Started/Installation/).

####Arch
```
sudo pacman -S hyprland
```
if you use yay, installation from AUR
```
yay -S hyprland-git
```
